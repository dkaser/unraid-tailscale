## Initial Configuration

You may want to disable key expiration for your server (either by using an 
auth key and connecting via the CLI, or afterwards via the Tailscale admin
console).

## System Settings

### Enable IP Forwarding

This setting modifies the sysctl settings for IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding.
This is useful when Tailscale is configured to be a subnet router or
exit node.

When set to Yes, IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding are both turned on.  
When set to No, the plugin does not modify the forwarding settings.

### Taildrop Location

Enter a valid path here to enable the Unraid server to accept files via
Taildrop.

If this setting is configured, Tailscale will be restarted when the array
starts; this is required for the Taildrop folder to be detected and used.

## Tailscale Settings

### Accept Routes

This setting modifies the Tailscale --accept-routes setting.

When set to Yes, --accept-routes is set to True.
When set to No, --accept-routes is set to False.
When set to Ignore, the plugin does not modify --accept-routes. (Useful if you prefer to configure the setting via CLI).

### Accept DNS

This setting modifies the Tailscale --accept-dns setting.

When set to Yes, --accept-dns is set to True.
When set to No, --accept-dns is set to False.
When set to Ignore, the plugin does not modify --accept-dns. (Useful if you prefer to configure the setting via CLI).

## Certificates

A Tailscale HTTPS certificate can be used for the WebGUI. Your hostname must
match the name used for the machine in Tailscale.

1. Enable HTTPS for your tailnet.
2. Set the **Local TLD** in **Settings**->**Management Access** to your
   Tailnet name (as displayed in the [DNS](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns)
   page of your Tailscale admin console)
2. Generate a new certificate and copy the to the WebGUI configuration.
   (This can also be run via the User Scripts plugin.)
```
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs
cd /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs

source /boot/config/ident.cfg
FQDN=$(hostname).${LOCAL_TLD%%[[:cntrl:]]}

# Have Tailscale generate a new certificate if needed
tailscale cert $FQDN

# Build the PEM bundle
cat /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.crt > /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.pem
cat /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.key >> /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.pem

# Update the WebGUI certificate
echo "Copying certificate to WebGUI config"
cp -v /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.pem /boot/config/ssl/certs/$(hostname)_unraid_bundle.pem
echo "Restarting WebGUI"
/etc/rc.d/rc.nginx reload
```

It is also possible to use these certificates for Docker containers. For
example, to use the generated certificate for Minio:
```
# Copy the files to the Minio container
echo "Copying certificate to Minio"
cp -v /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.crt /mnt/user/appdata/minio/certs/public.crt
cp -v /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.key /mnt/user/appdata/minio/certs/private.key
echo "Restarting Minio"
docker restart Minio
```

## Support

Support for this plugin is available via the [support thread](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/136889-plugin-tailscale/)
on the Unraid forums.

**Support for use of advanced networking features such as
subnet routers or docker ipvlan/macvlan networks will be
limited since advanced network features can be dependent 
by the underlying network configuration.**
