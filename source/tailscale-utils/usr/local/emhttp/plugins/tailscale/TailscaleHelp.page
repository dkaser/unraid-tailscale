## Initial Configuration

Open a console and use the tailscale CLI: https://tailscale.com/cli.  
Most users will simply need to run `tailscale up` and log in via their web
browser. Alternately, you can use an auth key with `tailscale up --authkey`.

You may want to disable key expiration for your server (either by using an 
auth key when connecting, or afterwards via the Tailscale admin console).

Additional Tailscale features (such as running as an exit node or subnet
router) can be enabled via the Tailscale CLI.

## Settings

### Enable IP Forwarding

This setting modifies the sysctl settings for IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding.
This is useful when Tailscale is configured to be a subnet router or
exit node.

When set to Yes, IPv4 and IPv6 forwarding are both turned on.  
When set to No, the plugin does not modify the forwarding settings.

### Taildrop Location

Enter a valid path here to enable the Unraid server to accept files via
Taildrop.

If this setting is configured, Tailscale will be restarted when the array
starts; this is required for the Taildrop folder to be detected and used.

## Certificates

A Tailscale HTTPS certificate can be used for the WebGUI. Your hostname must
match the name used for the machine in Tailscale.

1. Enable HTTPS for your tailnet.
2. Set the **Local TLD** in **Settings**->**Management Access** to your
   Tailnet name (as displayed in the [DNS](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns)
   page of your Tailscale admin console)
2. Generate a new certificate and copy the to the WebGUI configuration.
   (This can also be run via the User Scripts plugin.)
```
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs
cd /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs

source /boot/config/ident.cfg
FQDN=$(hostname).${LOCAL_TLD%%[[:cntrl:]]}

# Have Tailscale generate a new certificate if needed
tailscale cert $FQDN

# Build the PEM bundle
cat /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.crt > /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.pem
cat /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.key >> /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.pem

# Update the WebGUI certificate
echo "Copying certificate to WebGUI config"
cp -v /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.pem /boot/config/ssl/certs/$(hostname)_unraid_bundle.pem
echo "Restarting WebGUI"
/etc/rc.d/rc.nginx reload
```

It is also possible to use these certificates for Docker containers. For
example, to use the generated certificate for Minio:
```
# Copy the files to the Minio container
echo "Copying certificate to Minio"
cp -v /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.crt /mnt/user/appdata/minio/certs/public.crt
cp -v /boot/config/plugins/tailscale/certs/$FQDN.key /mnt/user/appdata/minio/certs/private.key
echo "Restarting Minio"
docker restart Minio
```

## Support

Support for this plugin is available via the [support thread](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/136889-plugin-tailscale/)
on the Unraid forums.

**Support for use of advanced networking features such as
subnet routers or docker ipvlan/macvlan networks will be
limited since advanced network features can be dependent 
by the underlying network configuration.**
